# Review for Vishwajeet Shelar (vys217)

Hey Vishwajeet, I really like the amount of effort that you put into making your plot, especially how you have five separate plots with the same x-axis. I also liked how you mentioned that the spikes in the plots are due to incorrect data entries in the caption. It would be really great if you took one step further and removed these data. A big issue with your plot is that it might be misleading because the purpose of the plot is to compare the five different categories. Yet, these categories all have extremely different y-axes. A remedy to this issue might be considering using log plots. Overall, great job!
