“The purpose of the present peer review is to assess the material submitted by Kevin Han as part of the Principles of Urban Informatics coursework. Throughout the mentioned exercise, I will perform a three-part evaluation of the student’s visualization assignment. The plot’s clarity will be determined by its accessibility component-a clear plot would display unambiguous quantities- the esthetics will be linked to the student’s choice of colors and graphical elements-how functional and communicative are those elements?-and the honesty criteria will be connected to the lack of intentional data deformation by the plot creator-is the data being reproduced in a transparent way?.For homework 7 Kevin Han chose to plot a student’s t-distribution with seven degrees of freedom. The visualization clearly displays selected degrees of freedom –DF- in a Gaussian distribution with x axis limits -5, 5. Both the DF’s color choices and the inclusion of a legend, increase plot esthetics as they establish differences amongst values and provide information on which color represent which DF. Given the fact that Kevin chose random values, it is not possible to detect any form of data deformation when analysis the plot.Kevin Han’s plot is clear, aesthetic and communicative. The information displayed as part of his assignment is a transparent reproduction of a generic student’s t-distribution. However, it would have been helpful to include a short caption below the visualization in order to explicitly communicate its purpose-what is a student’s t-distribution-and how were the DFs selected.”
